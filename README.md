This was a project using the Leap Motion Device, a small camera you can attach to your computer.
at the start, the device recognized the movement of the bones in your hand
the project was to record this movement, and using 3d arrays, get the program to recognize American sign language numbers 1 through 10
an additional function was required afterwards, so I added the function that taught basic addition


This project normally included a ton of data from my fellow classmates, but my pinkies are shaped oddly, and a number of ASL number
signs require your pinkies to be used, so for those numbers I had to create my own data sets. Data sets in this case are pictures taken
of your hand doing the correct sign, saved as a 3d array of finger bone positions.

Final notes, this project was weird going in and weird when I was finished. I never would have imagined that I would use my fingerbones
as a method of record hand position, but thats the world we live in now. Beyond the unusable data sets of my class mates (which was not
their fault) the major challenges i faced during this project was that the leap motion devices all had varying ages and levels of
funciton. Particularly, mine would heat up after roughly 4 minutes of use hot enough to cause minor burns. My desk will never be the same!
this also effected its ability to record, so i had to carefully space out my recording times. And also make sure to never touch it.
